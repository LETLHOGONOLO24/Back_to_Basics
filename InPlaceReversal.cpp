PROBLEM


Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list in-place and
return the new head.

That means you are not allowed to use extra data structures like
arrays or stacks â€” you must modify the pointers directly.

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL


STEPS


1 - prev keeps track of the previous node (starts as NULL since the
    first node will become the last)
    - current starts at the head node

    - next temporarily stores the next node before we change pointers

2 - while (current != NULL) { We repeat this for every node until
    current becomes NULL.
    - next = current->next; next is the 2nd node or the node next to the
    current

    - current->next = prev; we're saying the pointer that is pointing to
    next is going to point to previous which is null
    - prev = current; we're 
    - current = next; we say current is the next node
