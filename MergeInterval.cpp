PROBLEM


You are given an array of intervals where
intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i].

Merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-
overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.


Example 1:

Input:
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Output:
[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Explanation:
Intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap â†’ merged into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input:
intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]

Output:
[[1,5]]

Explanation:
Even though the end of one interval equals the start of another,
they are merged since they touch.

Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4

intervals[i].length == 2

0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4
